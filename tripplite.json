The rack is 30 inches wide, which provides more space for high-density equipment installations. The extra-deep frame has front and rear mounting rails to accept standard 19-inch rack equipment up to 41 inches (1041 millimeters) deep. Made of fully welded steel, the frame has a black powder-coated finish for durability. Maximum stationary load capacity is 3000 pounds (1361 kilograms). Maximum rolling load capacity is 2000 pounds (907 kilograms).",
            "Supports Baying Multiple Enclosures in a Row": "A removable solid divider panel is included for use when several cabinets are bayed together. The divider panel, located on the left side of the enclosure, has grommets for cable pass-through to ensure access between racks, protect cables from damage and provide an additional air seal. Baying hardware is included. Optional side panels are sold separately.",
            "Integrated Airflow Management Promotes Efficiency": "Both the front door and rear split door have an open perforation pattern to promote high airflow through the rack. The reversible doors lock using the included keys to help prevent tampering, theft and other unauthorized access. In the front frame uprights, cable pass-throughs with oval grommets minimize air leakage. The top panel has two six-inch-wide openings with brush strips that allow cable egress while blocking unwanted airflow.",
            "Offers Convenient Deployment and Equipment Installation": "The Paramount enclosure ships fully assembled for quick and easy deployment. Included swivel casters enable precise positioning on the floor. Once the rack is in position, leveling feet provide stabilization. Front and rear mounting rails accept standard 19-inch rack equipment. The rear upright offers space for side-by-side mounting of up to two vertical (0U) PDUs (sold separately) to maximize equipment space in the rack. ",

It is 800 millimeters (31.5 inches) wide to allow more room for cable management and PDU mounting along the sides of the rack, which permits free front-to-rear airflow. Constructed from heavy-duty steel with a durable black powder-coated finish, the SR42UBWD8 has a maximum stationary load capacity of 3500 pounds (1588 kilograms) and a maximum rolling load capacity of 2250 pounds (1021 kilograms).",
            "Keeps Important Equipment Secure": "The reversible front door, split rear doors and half-size side panels lock securely with the included keys to help prevent damage, tampering or theft. The doors, side panels and roof panel are designed for quick release, making it simple to access connected equipment and cabling with little effort. The roof panel has strategically placed pass-throughs to accommodate cables from vertical 0U PDUs and other connected equipment. The perforated doors allow generous airflow from front to rear to keep your equipment cool and functioning at their peak.",
            "Easy Enclosure and Equipment Installation": "This 42U server rack comes fully assembled for quick deployment with pre-installed removable casters that let you maneuver it over a level surface and through a standard doorway into position, where it can be stabilized by adjusting the removable levelers. Toolless 0U mounting rails allow quick installation of compatible PDUs and vertical cable managers. Built-in baying brackets allow the combination of two or more rack cabinets in a row.",
            "Meets Payment Card Industry Standards": "The SR42UBWD8 provides physical equipment and media security required for PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance. This is essential for companies that process, store and/or transmit credit card information."

            "Wide Server Rack Accommodates 42U of Rack Equipment and Side Cable Management": "This SmartRack® 45U server rack is designed for network wiring closets, retail locations, classrooms, back offices and other areas with essential rack-mount IT equipment. It is 750 millimeters wide to allow more room for cable management and PDU mounting along the sides of the rack, which permits free front-to-rear airflow. Constructed from heavy-duty steel with a durable black powder-coated finish, the SR45UBWDSP1 has a maximum stationary load capacity of 3500 pounds (1588 kilograms) and a maximum rolling load capacity of 2250 pounds (1020 kilograms).",
            "Ships on a Special Shock-Absorbing Pallet for Extra Safety": "The SR45UBWDSP1 comes mounted on a special pallet that features additional reinforcement and shock-absorbing material. The pallet's protective cushion safeguards the enclosure and the precision components it contains during re-shipping. Reinforced pallets and reusable packaging provide the flexibility to fully configure rack enclosures in a centralized location and safely re-ship them to remote sites, saving significant service costs. They also allow the freedom to custom-configure enclosures with network and server hardware, UPS systems, PDUs, KVM switches and a variety of other devices prior to final installation. At the desired location, the SR45UBWDSP1 can be easily maneuvered with its preinstalled (removable) casters, rolled off the pallet on included heavy-duty ramps and secured by adjusting the preinstalled levelers.",
            "Keeps Important Equipment Secure": "The reversible front door, split rear doors and half-size side panels lock securely to help prevent damage, tampering or theft. The doors, side panels and top panel are designed for quick release, making it easy to access connected equipment and cabling with little effort. Convenient top access ports and an open bottom allow easy cable routing through the cabinet. The vented doors allow generous airflow from front to rear to keep your equipment cool and functioning at their peak.",
            "Easy Equipment Installation": "Front and rear pairs of vertical mounting rails adjust in quarter-inch increments to accommodate equipment up to 37 inches (940 millimeters) deep. Each rack space is numbered for quick reference, and an easy-view depth index ensures consistent rail placement without time-consuming measurements. Toolless 0U mounting rails allow quick installation of up to four compatible PDUs and vertical cable managers.",

The doors, side panels and roof panel are designed for quick release, making it simple to access connected equipment and cabling with little effort. The roof panel has strategically placed pass-throughs to accommodate cables from vertical 0U PDUs and other connected equipment. The perforated doors allow generous airflow from front to rear to keep your equipment cool and functioning at their peak.",

Toolless 0U mounting rails allow quick installation of compatible PDUs and vertical cable managers. Built-in baying brackets allow the combination of two or more rack cabinets in a row.",
            "Extra Width Offers More Installation Options": "The SR48UBWD8 is 800 millimeters (31.5 inches) wide to allow more room for cable management and PDU mounting along the sides of the rack, which permits free front-to-rear airflow.",

            "Large-Capacity Self-Contained Rack-Mount Cooling Unit Ideal for Your Server Room": "The SmartRack® 5.5 kW Self-Cooling Server Rack is designed for server rooms or similar single-rack installations, particularly at the edge of a network. It provides closed-loop precision cooling for reliably protecting mission-critical equipment from overheating in environments without room for a bulky in-row unit. It is also convenient for customers looking to avoid the time and expense of a more complex HVAC solution. The self-contained and close-coupled SRCOOL5KWRM42U is delivered as a kit with the cooling unit pre-installed at the bottom of the 42U rack.",
            "5.5kW Cooling Capacity Protects Your Equipment and Prevents Expensive Downtime": "This precision air conditioning system delivers 5.5 kW (18,766 BTU) of cooling to your rack equipment to help prevent sudden shutdowns, malfunctions and other failures caused by overheating or fluctuating temperatures. The SRCOOL5KWRM42U is ideal for tight-fitting edge server rooms and other mission-critical IT applications, including retail and commercial outlets (storefronts and branch offices), light industrial environments (factories and warehouses) and research/development locations (laboratories and workshops).",
            "Rack AC Unit Focuses Cold Air Where It&rsquo;s Most Needed": "The SRCOOL5KWRM42U uses environmentally friendly R410A refrigerant to focus cold air directly into the rack to efficiently cool equipment. Variable fan speed adjusts the cooling output to the need of the IT load to prevent on/off cycling and large temperature swings.  The rack is delivered with a full set of 1U blanks pre-installed on the rack's front rails, which funnels the cold air through the IT equipment only. The 1U blanks should only be removed to install IT equipment in order to optimize the flow of cold air through IT equipment from  the front of the rack to the rear of the rack. A color touchscreen LCD allows convenient status monitoring and diagnostics right at your fingertips. ",
            "Features 3 User-Selectable Condensate Removal Methods": "You may choose from three condensate removal methods. Condensate evaporation is defaulted (1), but you may re-configure it to water pump removal (2) or gravity condensate removal (3) if your location has a water drain nearby. In case of a leak, the SRCOOL5KWRM42U includes internal leak detection, which will automatically turn off the cooling system to prevent condensate from entering the rack.",
            "Commercial-Grade Components for Reliable Performance": "With a 100-percent duty cycle, the SRCOOL5KWRM42U can run continuously without costly downtime. It uses copper tubing that is stronger than the aluminum tubing used in most consumer cooling units. The copper allows higher pressures and better weld joints to stand up to the constant vibration of the running compressor.",
            "Emergency Vent Allows Hot Air to Vent Out During Power Emergencies": "The emergency fallback ventilation system activates in the case of a cooling failure and if the inside rack temperature reaches 104°F (40°C). The emergency vents have embedded thermal sensors, which trigger the vents to open, allowing the hot air to escape the rack and protect critical IT equipment from overheating. If the emergency vents open, an alert will be sent to notify the IT manager.",
            "Remote Network Interface Offers 24/7 Monitoring and Control": "The built-in WEBCARDLXMINI network management card adds peace of mind when monitoring remotely. You can configure settings, events and actions, as well as power the unit on and off or graph temperatures over time without being on site. You can also receive configurable alarm notifications via email, SMS or SNMP. The SRCOOL5KWRM42U will restart automatically after a power failure.",
            "Rack Enclosure Keeps Important Equipment Secure": "The front door with clear acrylic windows and split rear door lock securely with the included keys to help prevent damage, tampering or theft. The bottom is designed to accommodate the cooling unit’s hot air exhaust duct.",
            "Convenient Space-Saving Design": "The 12U cooling unit is rack-mounted at the bottom of the 42U enclosure to save valuable rack space for PDUs, UPS systems, servers and cabling. With 3U of clearance required above the cooling unit, 27U is available for mounting rack equipment. This unit does not require a professional HVAC contractor, as the unit is pre-charged with refrigerant. <em><strong>Note</strong>: An optional 12-foot input power cable is included. Eaton offers full installation as part of a startup service part number.</em>"

The doors and side panels are designed for quick release, making it simple to access connected equipment and cabling with little effort. The removable roof panel has strategically placed pass-throughs to accommodate cables from vertical 0U PDUs and other equipment. The perforated front and split rear doors allow generous airflow from front to rear to help keep your equipment cool and functioning at its peak.",

This cabinet has a maximum stationary load capacity of 5000 pounds (2268 kilograms) and a maximum rolling load capacity of 3500 pounds (1588 kilograms).",
            "Keeps Servers and Other Equipment Secure": "The reversible front door, split rear doors and removable side panels lock securely with the included keys to help prevent damage, tampering or theft. The doors and side panels are designed for quick release, making it simple to access connected equipment and cabling with little effort. The removable roof panel has strategically placed pass-throughs to accommodate cables from vertical 0U PDUs and other equipment. The perforated front and split rear doors allow generous airflow from front to rear to help keep your equipment cool and functioning at its peak.",
            "White Server Rack Improves Visibility for Easier Maintenance": "The SRH42UWDPWD8 features a white powder-coated finish both inside and outside. This white rack makes it easier to see the equipment mounted inside high-density installations. Improved visibility of ports and cables allows easier, faster installation and maintenance and helps reduce accidental disconnections.",
            "Easy Enclosure and Equipment Installation": "This 42U server rack comes fully assembled for quick deployment with pre-installed casters that let you maneuver it over a level surface, where it can be stabilized by adjusting the levelers. Toolless 0U mounting rails allow quick installation of compatible PDUs and vertical cable managers. Built-in baying brackets allow the combination of two or more rack cabinets in a row.",
            "Extra Depth and Width Offer More Installation Options": "The SRH42UWDPWD8 is deeper than a standard rack’s 42 inches and wider than the usual 600 millimeters. At 46 inches (1168 millimeters) deep, this rack can accommodate larger, heavier servers and other equipment of equivalent mass. The rack’s 800-millimeter (31.5-inch) width provides side channels for mounting accessories, more room for routing cables and increased airflow to help keep equipment cool.",
            "Meets Payment Card Industry Standards": "The SRH42UWDPWD8 provides physical equipment and media security needed for PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance. This is essential for companies that process, store and/or send credit card information."

This cabinet has a maximum stationary load capacity of 5000 pounds (2268 kilograms) and a maximum rolling load capacity of 3500 pounds (1588 kilograms).",
            "Keeps AI Servers and Other Equipment Secure": "The reversible front door, split rear doors and removable side panels lock securely with the included keys to help prevent damage, tampering or theft. The doors and side panels are designed for quick release, making it simple to access connected equipment and cabling with little effort. The removable roof panel has strategically placed pass-throughs to accommodate cables from vertical 0U PDUs and other equipment. The perforated front and split rear doors allow generous airflow from front to rear to help keep your equipment cool and functioning at its peak.",
            "White Server Rack Improves Visibility for Easier Maintenance": "The SRH45UWDPWD8 features a white powder-coated finish both inside and outside. This white rack makes it easier to see the equipment mounted inside high-density installations. Improved visibility of ports and cables allows easier, faster installation and maintenance and helps reduce accidental disconnections.",
            "Easy Enclosure and Equipment Installation": "This 45U server rack comes fully assembled for quick deployment with pre-installed casters that let you maneuver it over a level surface, where it can be stabilized by adjusting the levelers. Toolless 0U mounting rails allow quick installation of compatible PDUs and vertical cable managers. Built-in baying brackets allow the combination of two or more rack cabinets in a row.",
            "Extra Depth and Width Offer More Installation Options": "The SRH45UWDPWD8 is deeper than a standard rack’s 42 inches and wider than the usual 600 millimeters. At 46 inches (1168 millimeters) deep, this rack can accommodate larger, heavier servers and other equipment of equivalent mass. The rack’s 800-millimeter (31.5-inch) width provides side channels for mounting accessories, more room for routing cables and increased airflow to help keep equipment cool.",
            "Meets Payment Card Industry Standards": "The SRH45UWDPWD8 provides physical equipment and media security needed for PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance. This is essential for companies that process, store and/or send credit card information."

This cabinet has a maximum stationary load capacity of 5000 pounds (2268 kilograms) and a maximum rolling load capacity of 3500 pounds (1588 kilograms).",
            "Keeps AI Servers and Other Equipment Secure": "The reversible front door, split rear doors and removable side panels lock securely with the included keys to help prevent damage, tampering or theft. The doors and side panels are designed for quick release, making it simple to access connected equipment and cabling with little effort. The removable roof panel has strategically placed pass-throughs to accommodate cables from vertical 0U PDUs and other equipment. The perforated front and split rear doors allow generous airflow from front to rear to help keep your equipment cool and functioning at its peak.",
            "White Server Rack Improves Visibility for Easier Maintenance": "The SRH48UWDPWD8 features a white powder-coated finish both inside and outside. This white rack makes it easier to see the equipment mounted inside high-density installations. Improved visibility of ports and cables allows easier, faster installation and maintenance and helps reduce accidental disconnections.",
            "Easy Enclosure and Equipment Installation": "This 48U server rack comes fully assembled for quick deployment with pre-installed casters that let you maneuver it over a level surface, where it can be stabilized by adjusting the levelers. Toolless 0U mounting rails allow quick installation of compatible PDUs and vertical cable managers. Built-in baying brackets allow the combination of two or more rack cabinets in a row.",
            "Extra Depth and Width Offer More Installation Options": "The SRH48UWDPWD8 is deeper than a standard rack’s 42 inches and wider than the usual 600 millimeters. At 46 inches (1168 millimeters) deep, this rack can accommodate larger, heavier servers and other equipment of equivalent mass. The rack’s 800-millimeter (31.5-inch) width provides side channels for mounting accessories, more room for routing cables and increased airflow to help keep equipment cool.",
            "Meets Payment Card Industry Standards": "The SRH48UWDPWD8 provides physical equipment and media security needed for PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance. This is essential for companies that process, store and/or send credit card information."
